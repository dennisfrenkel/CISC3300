1. What is PHP? What do server-side languages do in web development?
PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a popular open-source server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It processes data on the server, generates dynamic content, interacts with databases, and manages session information, ultimately sending HTML to the client. Server-side languages like PHP play a crucial role in web development by handling backend tasks that are not visible to users, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive websites.
2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
PHP and JavaScript share similarities, such as being widely used in web development and supporting object-oriented programming. However, they differ significantly in their execution environments: PHP is a server-side language that runs on the server to generate HTML, while JavaScript is a client-side language executed in the user's browser, enabling interactive features and real-time updates.
3. Why pick PHP over another server-side scripting language?
Choosing PHP over other server-side scripting languages can be advantageous due to its ease of use, extensive documentation, large community support, compatibility with various databases, and a range of strong frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, that simplify the development process.
4. What’s the difference between the include and require keywords in PHP?
In PHP, the keywords include and require are used to include files, but they behave differently. The include statement includes and evaluates a specified file; if the file is not found, it generates a warning but allows the script to continue executing. In contrast, require does the same but results in a fatal error if the file is missing, halting script execution entirely. If you attempt to use a variable from a file that hasn’t been included yet, you would encounter an undefined variable notice, as that variable does not exist in the current scope.
5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump.
echo and var_dump, both are used for output in PHP but serve different purposes. Echo is a language construct used to output one or more strings and does not return a value, making it faster for simple outputs. On the other hand, var_dump is a function that provides detailed information about one or more variables, including their data types and values, making it particularly useful for debugging. While echo is straightforward for displaying text, var_dump offers a more comprehensive view of variable contents.
