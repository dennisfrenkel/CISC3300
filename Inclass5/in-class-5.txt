1. The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
2. If a malicious user adds code to an input that is eventually generated as HTML, that code could potentially be run for different users, this is an example of XSS. 
3. HTML events are actions that happen to HTML elements. 
4. Even Listener sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. 
5. JQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. 
6. The val() function grabs the value of inputs in jQuery.
