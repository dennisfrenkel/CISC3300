9. errors or exceptions def
Exceptions are unexpected events or errors that interrupt the normal execution of a program, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero. When these events occur, they prevent the code from completing and can cause the program to crash if not properly handled. To maintain and prevent crashes, exceptions are typically handled through specialized code blocks that mitigate their impact and ensure graceful degradation. Effective exception handling is important for proper performance.
