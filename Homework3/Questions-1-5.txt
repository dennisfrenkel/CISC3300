1. What is javascript? How does an interpreted programming language differ from a
compiled language?
- JavScript is a programming language which is usually used for front end by web developers to add a sort-of 
dynamic/interactive interactions on web pages, games, etc. Interpreted languages are executed line by line at 
run-time, whereas compiled languages are converted into machine code beforehand, but requiere recompilation for 
code changes.
2. Contrast dynamically typed programming languages with statically typed ones. And
contrast strongly typed programming languages with weakly typed ones. (google these)
- Dynamically typed languages determine data types at runtime, allowing variables to change 
types during execution. This flexibility comes at the cost of potential runtime errors if data 
types are not handled correctly. Statically typed languages determine data types at compile time,
ensuring type safety but often requiring more verbose code. Strong versus weak typing: strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, meaning variables cannot be implicitly converted between types without explicit casting. This might reduce errors but can add complexity. On the other hand, weakly typed languages allow more implicit conversions between data types, leading to more flexible but potentially error-prone code.
3. What is the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JS?
- var is function-scoped or globally scoped and can be reassigned or redeclared. let is block-scoped and can 
be reassigned but not redeclared, providing better control over variable lifetimes. const is block-scoped and 
cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it suitable for constants.
4. What are anonymous functions? Higher order functions? Callback functions? First class
functions?
- Anonymous functions are functions without names, usually used as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.
Higher order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as results. Callback functions are functions passed as arguments 
to other functions to be executed at a later time. First-class functions are functions that can be treated like any other value in the language.
5. Define objects in JavaScript.
-In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and the value 
can be of any data type. Objects are used to store structured data and encapsulate related properties and behaviors.
