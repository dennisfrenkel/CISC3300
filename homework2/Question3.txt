Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they
different?
-  Both Flexbox and CSS Grid are layout systems designed to improve web page design. 
They are container-based, meaning they define a container element and rules for its children. 
Both systems also provide mechanisms for positioning child elements within the container.
However, there are key differences between the two. Flexbox is one-dimensional, meaning it arranges
elements in a single row or column. CSS Grid, on the other hand, is two-dimensional, allowing for more 
complex layouts with multiple rows and columns. Flexbox primarily controls the arrangement of child 
elements within the container. In terms of complexity, Flexbox is generally simpler to understand and use 
for basic layouts, while CSS Grid can be more complex, especially for complex layouts. Flexbox is well-suited 
for horizontal or vertical layouts and responsive design, while CSS Grid is ideal for creating complex layouts 
like grids.
